Absence of Anti-CSRF Tokens (Medium Risk)

Count: 19
Description: The application lacks proper Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protections.
Impact: Attackers could trick users into performing unintended actions on the authenticated web application.
Missing Security Headers (Medium to Low Risk)

Issues include:
Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set
Missing Anti-clickjacking Header
X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing
Impact: These missing headers could make the application more susceptible to various attacks including clickjacking and MIME type confusion attacks.
Information Disclosure (Low Risk)

Server leaks information via "X-Powered-By" HTTP response header
Server leaks version information via "Server" HTTP response header
Impact: This information could be used by attackers to fingerprint the technology stack and target known vulnerabilities.
Authentication Issues (Low Risk)

Authentication Request Identified: 2 instances
Description: Potential weaknesses in the authentication mechanism were detected.
Impact: Could lead to unauthorized access if exploited.


These risk ratings are based on the potential impact of each vulnerability and the likelihood of exploitation. The "Critical" and "High" risk vulnerabilities should be prioritized for immediate remediation due to their potential for significant damage if exploited. The "Medium" and "Low" risk issues should also be addressed, but may be considered lower priority compared to the more severe vulnerabilities. It's important to note that risk ratings can vary depending on the specific context of the application and the organization's risk tolerance. Regular reassessment of these ratings is recommended as part of an ongoing security program.
